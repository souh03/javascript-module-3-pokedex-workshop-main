## Protocols

In JavaScript Module II, we got our bearings by forming a picture of the two sides involved in an API, the server and the client. With a solid grasp on the who, we are ready to look deeper into how these two communicate. For context, we first look at the human model of communication and compare it to computers. After that, we move on to the specifics of a common protocol used in APIs.

### Knowing the Rules

People create social etiquette to guide their interactions. One example is how we talk to each other on the phone. Imagine yourself chatting with a friend. While they are speaking, you know to be silent. You know to allow them brief pauses. If they ask a question and then remain quiet, you know they are expecting a response and it is now your turn to talk.

Computers have a similar etiquette, though it goes by the term **"protocol"**. A computer protocol is an accepted set of rules that govern how two computers can speak to each other. Compared to our standards, however, a computer protocol is extremely rigid. Think for a moment of the two sentences "My favorite color is blue" and "Blue is my favorite color." People are able to break down each sentence and see that they mean the same thing, despite the words being in different orders. Unfortunately, computers are not that smart.

For two computers to communicate effectively, the server has to know exactly how the client will arrange its messages. You can think of it like a person asking for a mailing address. When you ask for the location of a place, you assume the first thing you are told is the street address, followed by the city, the state, and lastly, the zip code. You also have certain expectations about each piece of the address, like the fact that the zip code should only consist of numbers. A similar level of specificity is required for a computer protocol to work.

### The Protocol of the Web

There is a protocol for just about everything, each one tailored to do different jobs. You may have already heard of some: Bluetooth for connecting devices, and POP or IMAP for fetching emails.

On the web, the main protocol is the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, better known by its acronym, **HTTP**. When you type an address like `http://example.com` into a web browser, the "http" tells the browser to use the rules of HTTP when talking with the server.

With the ubiquity of HTTP on the web, many companies choose to adopt it as the protocol underlying their APIs. One benefit of using a familiar protocol is that it lowers the learning curve for developers, which encourages usage of the API. Another benefit is that HTTP has several features useful in building a good API, as we'll see later. Right now, let's brave the water and take a look at how HTTP works!

### HTTP Requests

Communication in HTTP centers around a concept called the Request-Response Cycle. The client sends the server a request to do something. The server, in turn, sends the client a response saying whether or not the server could do what the client asked.

![The Request-Response Cycle](images/The%20Request-Response%20Cycle.jpeg)

To make a valid request, the client needs to include four things:

- **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) 1
- **Method**
- List of **Headers**
- **Body**

That may sound like a lot of details just to pass along a message, but remember, computers have to be very specific to communicate with one another.

#### URL

URLs are familiar to us through our daily use of the web, but have you ever taken a moment to consider their structure? In HTTP, a URL is a unique address for a thing (a noun). Which things get addresses is entirely up to the business running the server. They can make URLs for web pages, images, or even videos of cute animals.

APIs extend this idea a bit further to include nouns like customers, products, and tweets. In doing so, URLs become an easy way for the client to tell the server which thing it wants to interact with. Of course, APIs also do not call them "things", but give them the technical name "resources."

#### Method

The request method tells the server what kind of action the client wants the server to take. In fact, the method is commonly referred to as the request "verb."

The four methods most commonly seen in APIs are:

- **GET** - Asks the server to retrieve a resource
- **POST** - Asks the server to create a new resource
- **PUT** - Asks the server to edit/update an existing resource
- **DELETE** - Asks the server to delete a resource

![Pizza](images/pizza.png)

Here's an example to help illustrate these methods. Let's say there is a pizza parlor with an API you can use to place orders. You place an order by making a POST request to the restaurant's server with your order details, asking them to create your pizza. As soon as you send the request, however, you realize you picked the wrong style crust, so you make a PUT request to change it.

While waiting on your order, you make a bunch of GET requests to check the status. After an hour of waiting, you decide you've had enough and make a DELETE request to cancel your order.

#### Headers

Headers provide meta-information about a request. They are a simple list of items like the time the client sent the request and the size of the request body.

Have you ever visited a website on your smartphone that was specially formatted for mobile devices? That is made possible by an HTTP header called "User-Agent." The client uses this header to tell the server what type of device you are using, and websites smart enough to detect it can send you the best format for your device.

There are quite a few HTTP headers that clients and servers deal with, so we will wait to talk about other ones until they are relevant in later sections.

#### Body

The request body contains the data the client wants to send the server. Continuing our pizza ordering example above, the body is where the order details go.

A unique trait about the body is that the client has complete control over this part of the request. Unlike the method, URL, or headers, where the HTTP protocol requires a rigid structure, the body allows the client to send anything it needs.

These four pieces — URL, method, headers, and body — make up a complete HTTP request.

![The structure of an HTTP request](images/The%20structure%20of%20an%20HTTP%20request.jpeg)

### HTTP Responses

After the server receives a request from the client, it attempts to fulfill the request and send the client back a response. HTTP responses have a very similar structure to requests. The main difference is that instead of a method and a URL, the response includes a status code. Beyond that, the response headers and body follow the same format as requests.

#### Status Codes

Status codes can be grouped into categories

- **1xx**: Informational
- **2xx**: Success
- **3xx**: Redirection
- **4xx**: Client Error
- **5xx**: Server Error

If you want a fun look at HTTP status codes, take a look at [Status Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com/) or [Status Cats](https://http.cat/) if you are cat person.

Status codes are three-digit numbers that each have a unique meaning. When used correctly in an API, this little number can communicate a lot of info to the client. For example, you may have seen this page during your internet wanderings:

![A default 404 web page](images/A%20default%20404%20web%20page.jpeg)

The status code behind this response is 404, which means "Not Found." Whenever the client makes a request for a resource that does not exist, the server responds with a 404 status code to let the client know: "that resource doesn't exist, so please don't ask for it again!"

There is a slew of other statuses in the HTTP protocol, including 200 ("success! that request was good") to 503 ("our website/API is currently down.") We'll learn a few more of them as they come up in later sections.

After a response is delivered to the client, the Request-Response Cycle is completed and that round of communication over. It is now up to the client to initiate any further interactions. The server will not send the client any more data until it receives a new request.

![The structure of an HTTP response](images/The%20structure%20of%20an%20HTTP%20response.jpeg)

### How APIs Build on HTTP

By now, you can see that HTTP supports a wide range of permutations to help the client and server talk. So, how does this help us with APIs? The flexibility of HTTP means that APIs built on it can provide clients with a lot of business potential. We saw that potential in the pizza ordering example above. A simple tweak to the request method was the difference between telling the server to create a new order or cancel an existing one. It was easy to turn the desired business outcome into an instruction the server could understand. Very powerful!

This versatility in the HTTP protocol extends to other parts of a request, too. Some APIs require a particular header, while others require specific information inside the request body. Being able to use APIs hinges on knowing how to make the correct HTTP request to get the result you want.

### How Data Formats Are Used In HTTP

As we've previously explored JSON data format, we need to know how to use it in HTTP. To do so, we will say hello again to one of the fundamentals of HTTP: **headers**. In previous section, we learned that headers are a list of information about a request or response. There is a header for saying what format the data is in: **Content-Type**.

When the client sends the Content-Type header in a request, it is telling the server that the data in the body of the request is formatted a particular way. If the client wants to send the server JSON data, it will set the Content-Type to `"application/json"`. Upon receiving the request and seeing that Content-Type, the server will first check if it understands that format, and, if so, it will know how to read the data. Likewise, when the server sends the client a response, it will also set the Content-Type to tell the client how to read the body of the response.

Sometimes, the client can only speak one data format. If the server sends back anything other than that format, the client will fail and throw an error. Fortunately, a second HTTP header comes to the rescue. The client can set the **Accept** header to tell the server what data formats it is able to accept. If the client can only speak JSON, it can set the Accept header to `"application/json"`. The server will then send back its response in JSON. If the server doesn't support the format the client requests, it can send back an error to the client to let it know the request is not going to work.

With these two headers, **Content-Type** and **Accept**, the client and server can work with the data formats they understand and need to work properly.

![Data format headers](images/Data%20format%20headers.jpeg)

Common **Content-Type** include:

- `text/html` - HTML web page
- `text/css` - CSS
- `image/jpeg` - JPEG image
- `application/javascript` - JavaScript code
- `application/json` - JSON data

## Fetch API

The Fetch API is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers. In addition, the Fetch API is much simpler and cleaner. It uses the **Promise** (will be discussed next) to deliver more flexible features to make requests to servers from the web browsers. The `fetch()` method is available in the global scope that instructs the web browsers to send a request to a URL.

### Sending a Request

The `fetch()` requires only one parameter which is the URL of the resource that you want to fetch:

```js
let response = fetch(url);
```

The `fetch()` method returns a `Promise` so you can use the `then()` and `catch()` methods to handle it:

```js
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    // handle the response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle the error
  });
```

When the request completes, the resource is available. At this time, the promise will resolve into a `Response` object.

The `Response` object is the API wrapper for the fetched resource. The `Response` object has a number of useful properties and methods to inspect the response.

### Reading the Response

If the contents of the response are in the `json` format, you can use the `json()` method. The `json()` method returns a Promise that resolves with the complete contents of the fetched resource:

```js
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

In practice, you often use the `async/await` with the `fetch()` method like this:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  let response = await fetch(url);
  let data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

### Promises

`fetch()` is an asynchronous function. What this function returns is a **Promise** object. This kind of object has three possible states: **pending**, **fullfilled** and **rejected**. It always starts off as pending and then it either resolves or rejects. Once a promise resolves it runs the `then` method. This method takes a callback function as an argument and passes the resolved value to it. Take a look:

```js
const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/";

fetch(url).then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
});
```

#### Chaining multiple then

`then`, just like the asynchronous function that we originally called, `fetch`, also returns a `Promise`. What it really means is that we can chain as many thens as we want. If we return a value from the callback passed to `then`, the `Promise` returned by the then method will resolve with the callback’s return value. That value will be passed to the callback function of the next `then`. This might sound complicated but it really isn’t:

```js
const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/";

fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((parsedResponse) => {
    console.log(parsedResponse);
  });
```

We call the API and it returns a json string. When that happens, in the then callback, we pass that response to the next `then`, converting it to a JavaScript object, using the `.json` method. There we can log the returned value.

#### Promise.catch

When an error occurs, `Promise` rejects and runs the `catch` method. Inside of this method we can handle the error. `catch` accepts a callback and passes the reason of rejection to it. We can chain a `catch` method with a `then` like this:

```js
const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/aaaa";

fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((parsedResponse) => {
    console.log(parsedResponse.image);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log(reason.toString());
  });
```

We added catch at the end so that if anything goes wrong inside fetch or any of the attached thens, the `catch` at the end will handle it. `catch` returns a `Promise` just like `then`. I changed the url to an invalid one so you can see that the `catch` block works.

As you can see, our code grows from top to bottom instead of getting deeply nested. That way it’s more readable than nested callback functions.

We can shorten our code like this if we want:

```js
const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/aaaa";

fetch(url)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((parsed) => console.log(parsed.image))
  .catch((reason) => console.log(reason.toString()));
```

Note that you can also pass the error handling function as the second argument to `then` instead of adding a `catch` block:

```js
fetch(url).then(handleSuccess, handleFailure);
```

### Async await

We can simplify our code using the ES7 async await syntax. It is simply a new way of handling Promises.

```js
async function getFox() {
  const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/";
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const jsonRes = await res.json();
  console.log(jsonRes.image);
}

getFox();
```

We use the `async` keyword in front of our function to declare an asynchronous function. In such function we can use the `await` keyword. We use it anytime we would use `.then`. Such expression pauses the execution of the function and returns the Promise’s value once it resolves.

Async functions return promises. That means we can use `then` on them:

```js
async function getFox() {
  const url = "https://randomfox.ca/floof/";
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const jsonRes = await res.json();
  return jsonRes;
}

getFox().then((fox) => console.log(fox.image));
```

#### Async await error handling

Just like we did with `then`, we can also add a `catch`:

```js
async function getFox() {
  const url = "https://aaa";
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const jsonRes = await res.json();
  return jsonRes;
}

getFox()
  .then((fox) => console.log(fox.image))
  .catch((reason) => console.log(reason.toString()));
```

But we can also use `try…catch`:

```js
async function getFox() {
  try {
    const url = "https://aaa";
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const jsonRes = await res.json();
    return jsonRes;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e.toString());
  }
}

getFox().then((fox) => console.log(fox.image));
```

If anything in the `try` block goes wrong, control jumps to `catch` and passes the reason of rejection to it. Note that **it will catch errors in asynchronous actions only if the `await` keyword is present in front**. Otherwise the error will slip by.

## Destructuring

Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in (possibly nested) objects and arrays.

It can be used in locations that receive data and the way to extract the values is specified via destructuring patterns.

### Object Destructuring

Before ES6 we had to capture the values individually using dot notation and store them in variables.

With ES6 we can capture the values in an easier way using a destructuring pattern to save the values in variables.

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

// ES5 Way
const firstName = person.firstName;
const lastName = person.lastName;

console.log(firstName); // Jane
console.log(lastName); // Doe

// ES6 Way
const { firstName, lastName } = person;

console.log(firstName); // Jane
console.log(lastName); // Doe
```

### Default Values

If the property don’t exist on the object we can provide a default value which will be used when the property is `undefined`.

```js
const person = { firstName: "Jane" };

// ES5 Way
const lastName = person.lastName || "Doe";
console.log(lastName); // Doe

// ES6 Way
const { firstName, lastName = "Doe" } = person;
console.log(lastName); // Doe
```

### Array Destructuring

Destructuring can also be used to capture data from arrays and, in the same way as with objects, we can provide default values.

```js
// we can skip elements with an empty comma
// the `last` item has a default value
let [zero, , , third, , , last = "Empty"] = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
];

console.log(zero); // Monday
console.log(third); // Thursday
console.log(last); // Empty
```

### ...rest Operator

We can use the `...rest` operator to capture individual values in variables and all the other variables in an array.

It can also be used in functions to capture the parameters.

```js
const [x, ...y] = ["a", "b", "c"];
console.log(x); // x = 'a';
console.log(y); // y = ['b', 'c']

// also works with function parameters
function args(a, b, ...rest) {
  console.log(a); // 1
  console.log(b); // 2
  console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}

args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);
```

### Practical Uses Of Destructuring #1

```js
// Destructure function parameters
function removeBreakpoint({ url, line, column }) {
  console.log(url); // => "the-url"
  console.log(line); // => 33
  console.log(column); // => 60
}

let options = {
  url: "the-url",
  line: 33,
  column: 60,
};

removeBreakpoint(options);

function returnMultipleValues() {
  return {
    foo: 1,
    bar: 2,
  };
}

// Destructure the returned value of a function
const { foo, bar } = returnMultipleValues();

console.log(foo); // => 1
console.log(bar); // => 2
```

### Practical Uses Of Destructuring #2

```js
function weekDays() {
  return ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"];
}

// Destructure the returned value of a function
const [monday, ...otherDays] = weekDays();

console.log(monday); // => Monday
console.log(otherDays); // => ["Tuesday", "Wednesday"]
```

## Default Parameters

Pre `ES6`, setting a default value to one of the parameters of a function was pretty verbose and long to write.

```js
function compute(num, times) {
  if (num === undefined) {
    num = 1;
  }
  if (times === undefined) {
    times = 1;
  }

  return num * times;
}

let num1 = compute();
console.log(num1); // => 1

let num2 = compute(2);
console.log(num2); // => 2

let num3 = compute(2, 2);
console.log(num3); // => 4
```

In `ES6`, now it is much easier to set a default value to the parameters of a function if we don’t provide an argument for each parameter.

```js
// Now it is much easier to set a default value
function compute(num = 1, times = 1) {
  return num * times;
}

let num1 = compute();
console.log(num1); // => 1

let num2 = compute(2);
console.log(num2); // => 2

let num3 = compute(2, 2);
console.log(num3); // => 4
```

Passing `undefined` as an argument will trigger the parameter to take the default value.

```js
function compute(num = 1, times = 1) {
  return num * times;
}

let num1 = compute(undefined, 20);
console.log(num1); // => 20

let num2 = compute(undefined, undefined);
console.log(num2); // => 1
```

## Pokedex

In Pokemon lore, the Pokedex is a Pokemon dictionary that the characters carry with them. In this device, they can query the Pokemons and learn details about them, such as, abilities, type of Pokemon, strengths and weaknesses. The different designs of the Pokedex can be found online. Students are encouraged to take examples online and implement them. Here is a sample UI of Pokedex.

### Requirements

1. Develop a search field where users will search for Pokemon’s name or id.
   - Create a field and button.
   - Add a callback to the button event listener.
2. Make a request by Pokemon ID or name. PokeApi already can handle both.
   - There are some Pokemons that don’t exist but should, 999 doesn’t exist but 1000 does.
   - This is a perfect example of interacting with the response’s status code and adjusting their app to it.
   - The default param of the fetch function is a GET method.
3. Display important information on the Pokemons. All this information is available on the first REST call to the API.
   - Name (Bulbasaur, Charizard, Pikachu)
   - Skills (Lighting-rod, static)
   - Type of Pokemon (Ghost, Poison, Fire)
   - Pokemon Sprites
